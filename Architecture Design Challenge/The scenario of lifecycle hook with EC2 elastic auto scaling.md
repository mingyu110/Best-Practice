### The scenarios of lifecycle hook with EC2 elastic auto scaling

Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling offers the ability to add lifecycle hooks to your Auto Scaling groups. These hooks let you create solutions that are aware of events in the Auto Scaling instance lifecycle, and then perform a custom action on instances when the corresponding lifecycle event occurs. A lifecycle hook provides a specified amount of time (one hour by default) to wait for the action to complete before the instance transitions to the next state.

The implementation of lifecycle hooks with auto scaling groups enables the execution of custom actions prior to instance launch or termination, facilitating seamless initialization or cleanup processes and thereby enhancing application stability.

The Lifecycle Hook can be utilized to incorporate a custom function prior to the creation or termination of EC2 instances. It is important to comprehend that there are three available options within the Lifecycle Hook, namely EventBridge, SNS, and SQS.

Let us examine the diagram presented below:

The official AWS documentation[Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling lifecycle hooks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/lifecycle-hooks.html) should be consulted for more comprehensive information

- The game server automatically halts the instance to optimize capacity
  > The lifecycle hooks can be configured during the instance's startup or termination process, enabling you to invoke lambda functions, send SNS messages, or even trigger Step Functions to execute a sequence of tasks prior to terminating the instance. For instance, you can periodically check the game server status to determine if any players are still engaged in combat and adjust the instance state accordingly to allow AutoScaling to proceed with termination.

- The logs of EC2 instances are saved on S3 buckets through the utilization of lifecycle hooks

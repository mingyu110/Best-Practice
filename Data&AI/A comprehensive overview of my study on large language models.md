### A comprehensive overview of my study on large language models
#### The developmental process of large language models
- Data collection: Conduct extensive data collection of textual content, encompassing a wide range of sources such as books, news articles, social media posts, web pages, etc., with the purpose of training the model.
- Data preprocessing: the collected data undergo cleaning, word segmentation, stop word removal, and stemming to enhance the model's training effectiveness.
- Model design: Opt for an appropriate model architecture, such as Transformer, to facilitate the natural language processing of textual data.
- Model training: involves utilizing the collected data to facilitate the acquisition of rules and patterns within the text data by the model
- Model optimization: involves fine-tuning hyperparameters, implementing regularization techniques, leveraging pre-trained models, and other strategies to enhance performance and improve generalization capabilities.
- Model evaluation: entails the utilization of test data to comprehensively assess the performance and impact of the model.
- Model deployment: The trained model is deployed in a production environment for the purpose of natural language processing of textual data.

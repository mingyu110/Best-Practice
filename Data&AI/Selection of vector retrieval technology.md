#### Embedding
The vectors serve as abstractions for diverse unstructured data generated by individuals/objects/scenes in the physical world (such as voice, image, video, language, text, behavior, etc.), akin to coordinates in mathematical space that identify each entity and its relationships. This process of transforming unstructured data into a vector representation is referred to as Embedding.

#### Vector retrieval
The purpose of vector retrieval is to search for identical or similar vectors generated from unstructured data in order to locate corresponding unstructured data with the same or similar characteristics.

#### The retrieval of unstructured data (voice, image, video)

#### The knowledge repository of a large-scale model

#### Information retrieval, Personalized recommendations, Targeted advertising

#### Embedding
The vectors serve as abstractions for diverse unstructured data generated by individuals/objects/scenes in the physical world (such as voice, image, video, language, text, behavior, etc.), akin to coordinates in mathematical space that identify each entity and its relationships. This process of transforming unstructured data into a vector representation is referred to as Embedding.

#### Vector retrieval
The purpose of vector retrieval is to search for identical or similar vectors generated from unstructured data in order to locate corresponding unstructured data with the same or similar characteristics.

#### The retrieval of unstructured data (voice, image, video)

#### The knowledge repository of a large-scale model

#### Conventional techniques for vector retrieval
- The primary objective of vector retrieval is to address the challenges posed by KNN and RNN problems
  > - KNN（K-Nearest Neighbor）：The algorithm identifies the K nearest points to the query point.
  > - RNN (Radius Nearest Neighbor)：Finds all points or N points within a radius of the query point.
#### How to solve KNN and RNN problems
- Brute Force

  The Brute Force algorithm is a brute matching technique that systematically scans all vector features in order to identify the K vectors that are closest to the query point. This method guarantees 100% accuracy and is particularly suitable for scenarios with small data sizes or where absolute precision is essential.The Linear method in OpenSearch and the FLAT method in Milvus are both examples of Brute Force methods.

- ANN

  The task of ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor) search involves finding the k points in a given space, such as D-dimensional Euclidean space, that are closest to a query vector q from a point set S. In ANN search, it is generally acceptable to have some error in identifying the exact nearest k neighbors. If the set of results R is obtained and compared with the actual set of nearest neighbors N, then the recall rate in ANN search refers to ：

   The speed of the search is evaluated based on throughput or delay, which refers to the time required for conducting an ANN search for a specific q after a given S. Throughput, on the other hand, indicates the number of ANN searches that can be processed per unit time following a given S and is commonly measured in terms of Queries Per Second (QPS).

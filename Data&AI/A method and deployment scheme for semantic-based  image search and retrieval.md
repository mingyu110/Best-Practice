### A method and deployment scheme for semantic-based image search and retrieval

#### Background
- The retrieval of images (including text and image search) is a prevalent application scenario across various industries. For instance, in the context of an online shopping platform, users can perform similar product searches based on map-based queries. Similarly, in the domain of cloud photo albums, relevant image materials can be located by conducting searches using specific images.

#### The scheme's introduction

- CLIP Model
  - CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Pre-training) builds on a large body of work on zero-shot transfer, natural language supervision, and multimodal learning,allowing AI to understand the relationship between images and their corresponding descriptions.

- Amazon OpenSearch k-NN
  - The Amazon OpenSearch platform provides support for k-NN search, enabling the identification of the "nearest neighbor" between points in a vector space through either Euclidean or cosine distance metrics.

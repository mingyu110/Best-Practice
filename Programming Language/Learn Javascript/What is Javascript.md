- What is DOM
  - The Document Object Model (DOM) serves as the programming interface for HTML and XML documents, providing a structured representation of a document and defining a mechanism to programmatically manipulate its structure, style, and content. DOM employs parsing techniques to organize a document into a well-organized collection of nodes and objects that possess properties and methods. In essence, it establishes the linkage between web pages and scripts or programming languages.
- What is Event
  - The term "event" refers to an action or occurrence within a programming system, prompting the system to notify you of the possibility to respond in a specific manner if desired.

Here is an illustration of JavaScript initiating a payment request via a DOM eventï¼š
- Front-end integrated payment SDK
  - Front-end integrated payment SDKs enable direct initiation of payment requests on the client side, provided by certain payment providers through JavaScript SDKs
  - The SDK internally encapsulates the logic for invoking the payment interface and may incorporate security mechanisms (such as encryption and signing) to safeguard sensitive data
  - The invocation of a method provided by the SDK is triggered when a payment request is initiated through a DOM event, such as clicking a button
The provided SDK method is invoked when a DOM event, such as clicking a button, triggers a payment request. It is important to replace the above code with your actual payment SDK and its corresponding API call method during practical implementation. Additionally, it is crucial to adhere to the security guidelines of the payment service provider, handle sensitive information appropriately, and ensure compliance with relevant regulations like PCI DSS.
